6-LAYER DECISION TAXONOMY ANALYSIS (v2.1.1)
================================================================================

CRITICAL RULES ENFORCED:
  * Hard stops ONLY from Layer 1 facts (confirmed match, not screening)
  * Cash signals EXCLUDED from wire transactions
  * FORMING typologies = OBSERVE ONLY (not escalation)
  * Status alone is NEVER sufficient for suspicion

INSTRUMENT: CASH
HARD STOP: NO
OBLIGATIONS: 0 (none)
INDICATORS: 3 (all corroborated)
TYPOLOGY MATURITY: CONFIRMED
MITIGATIONS: 1
SUSPICION: ACTIVATED (intent + deception + pattern)
TAXONOMY VERDICT: ESCALATE - STR FILING REQUIRED

================================================================================
DUAL-GATE DECISION SYSTEM
================================================================================

Constitutional Rule:
"Escalation is prevented by default and permitted only when
 suspicion is affirmatively proven."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GATE 1: ZERO-FALSE-ESCALATION CHECKLIST
Purpose: Are we ALLOWED to escalate?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Section A (FACT-LEVEL HARD STOP VERIFICATION): FAIL
  Section B (INSTRUMENT & CONTEXT VALIDATION): PASS
  Section C (REGULATORY OBLIGATION ISOLATION): PASS
  Section D (INDICATOR CORROBORATION TEST): PASS
  Section E (TYPOLOGY MATURITY GATE): PASS
  Section F (MITIGATION OVERRIDE TEST): FAIL
  Section G (SUSPICION DEFINITION TEST (FINAL GATE)): PASS

  GATE 1 DECISION: PERMITTED
  Rationale: All gates passed. Escalation permitted with documented basis.

  GATE 1 DETAIL (PATH 2 - BEHAVIORAL SUSPICION):
  -----------------------------------------------
  Section A: FAIL - No fact-level hard stop (sanctions=NO_MATCH)
  Section B: PASS - CASH instrument correctly classified
  Section C: PASS - No obligations used as suspicion
  Section D: PASS - 3 corroborated indicators (structuring, UBO, new account)
  Section E: PASS - Typology CONFIRMED (structuring pattern)
  Section F: FAIL - Mitigations insufficient (1 factor, new account)
  Section G: PASS - Intent + Deception + Pattern all present

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose: Are we OBLIGATED to report?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Section 1 (LEGAL SUSPICION THRESHOLD): PASS
  Section 2 (EVIDENCE QUALITY TEST): PASS
  Section 3 (MITIGATION FAILURE CONFIRMATION): PASS
  Section 4 (TYPOLOGY CONFIRMATION (OPTIONAL)): PASS
  Section 5 (REGULATORY REASONABLENESS TEST (FINAL)): PASS

  GATE 2 DECISION: REQUIRED
  Rationale: All mandatory sections passed. STR filing is warranted.

  GATE 2 DETAIL:
  ---------------
  Section 1: PASS - Legal suspicion threshold met
    * Intent: Intent to evade statutory and internal transaction monitoring controls
    * Deception: Deception through materially inconsistent beneficial ownership declarations
    * Pattern: Sustained pattern of transactions structured below reporting thresholds
  Section 2: PASS - Evidence is fact-based, specific, reproducible
  Section 3: PASS - Mitigations fail to explain behavior
    * Explanation insufficient: YES
    * Docs unsupportive: YES
    * History misaligned: YES (new account)
  Section 4: PASS - Typology CONFIRMED (structuring)
  Section 5: PASS - Regulator would expect STR

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STR RATIONALE STATEMENT (MANDATORY OUTPUT)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Based on the totality of evidence, reasonable grounds exist to suspect
  that the transaction(s) may be related to money laundering or terrorist
  financing. This determination is based on:

  1. STRUCTURING PATTERN: Cash deposits structured to remain below the CAD 10,000 LCTR threshold.
     Two cash deposits totaling CAD 18,700 executed within 5.5 hours,
     each deliberately structured just below CAD 10,000.

  2. INTENT TO EVADE: Intent to evade statutory cash reporting requirements under PCMLTFA.
     Transaction amounts (CAD 9,500 and CAD 9,200) demonstrate clear
     intent to avoid Large Cash Transaction Report requirements.

  3. UBO DISCREPANCY: Declared UBO differs from incorporation documents or prior KYC record.
     This indicates potential deception regarding beneficial ownership.

  4. NEW ACCOUNT: Customer relationship is only 2 months old,
     with no established pattern of legitimate activity to establish baseline.

  5. HIGH-RISK PROFILE: Import/Export business with high inherent
     ML/TF risk and insufficient mitigating documentation.

  This report is submitted in accordance with PCMLTFA s.7.

================================================================================
ABSOLUTE RULES (NO EXCEPTIONS)
================================================================================
  X PEP status alone can NEVER escalate
  X Cross-border alone can NEVER escalate
  X Risk score alone can NEVER escalate
  X 'High confidence' can NEVER override facts
  X 'Compliance comfort' is NOT a reason

  NOTE: This escalation is based on OBSERVED BEHAVIOR (structuring),
        not status or score. The system correctly identified:
        - Factual transaction pattern
        - Confirmed typology (structuring)
        - Failed mitigations
        - Legal suspicion threshold met

================================================================================
FINAL DECISION
================================================================================
Verdict:        STR
Action:         FILE_STR
STR Required:   YES
Escalation:     PERMITTED

Rationale:
  1. Gate 1 (Escalation): PERMITTED via Path 2 (Behavioral Suspicion)
  2. Gate 2 (STR): REQUIRED - All mandatory sections passed
  3. Typology: CONFIRMED (Structuring - CAD 10K threshold evasion)
  4. Suspicion Elements: Intent + Deception + Sustained Pattern
  5. Mitigations: INSUFFICIENT (new account, no SOF, UBO discrepancy)

================================================================================
REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
================================================================================
PCMLTFA s.7:    Reasonable grounds to suspect ML/TF
FINTRAC:        STR filing required within 30 days
STR Filing:     REQUIRED
LCTR Required:  NO (individual cash transactions below CAD 10,000 threshold)
                Note: Total CAD 18,700 in 24h indicates threshold evasion

FINTRAC INDICATORS MATCHED:
  * Transactions structured to avoid Large Cash Transaction Report requirements
  * Multiple cash transactions in a single day just below CAD 10,000 threshold
  * New customer with limited or no transaction history
  * Beneficial ownership information contains discrepancies
  * Customer operates in high-risk industry sector
