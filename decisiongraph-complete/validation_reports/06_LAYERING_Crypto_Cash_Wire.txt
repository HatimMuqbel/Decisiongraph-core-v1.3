6-LAYER DECISION TAXONOMY ANALYSIS (v2.1.1)
================================================================================

CRITICAL RULES ENFORCED:
  * Instrument transitions evaluated holistically
  * Crypto exposure alone does NOT imply suspicion
  * Cash structuring + rapid movement establishes typology
  * Suspicion requires intent, deception, or sustained pattern

INSTRUMENT: MIXED (Crypto -> Cash -> Wire)
HARD STOP: NO
OBLIGATIONS: 0 (none)
INDICATORS: 5 (all corroborated)
TYPOLOGY MATURITY: CONFIRMED (Layering)
MITIGATIONS: 1 (insufficient)
SUSPICION: ACTIVATED (intent + sustained pattern)
TAXONOMY VERDICT: ESCALATE - STR FILING REQUIRED

================================================================================
DUAL-GATE DECISION SYSTEM
================================================================================

Constitutional Rule:
"Escalation is prevented by default and permitted only when
 suspicion is affirmatively proven."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GATE 1: ZERO-FALSE-ESCALATION CHECKLIST
Purpose: Are we ALLOWED to escalate?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Section A (FACT-LEVEL HARD STOP VERIFICATION): FAIL
  Section B (INSTRUMENT & CONTEXT VALIDATION): PASS
  Section C (REGULATORY OBLIGATION ISOLATION): PASS
  Section D (INDICATOR CORROBORATION TEST): PASS
  Section E (TYPOLOGY MATURITY GATE): PASS
  Section F (MITIGATION OVERRIDE TEST): FAIL
  Section G (SUSPICION DEFINITION TEST (FINAL GATE)): PASS

  GATE 1 DECISION: PERMITTED
  Rationale: All gates passed. Escalation permitted with documented basis.

  GATE 1 DETAIL (PATH 2 - BEHAVIORAL SUSPICION):
  -----------------------------------------------
  Section A: FAIL - No fact-level hard stop (no sanctions)
  Section B: PASS - Multi-instrument pattern correctly identified
  Section C: PASS - No obligations (not PEP)
  Section D: PASS - 5 corroborated indicators across transaction chain
  Section E: PASS - Typology CONFIRMED (Layering)
  Section F: FAIL - Mitigations insufficient (no business rationale)
  Section G: PASS - Intent + Sustained Pattern present

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GATE 2: POSITIVE STR CHECKLIST
Purpose: Are we OBLIGATED to report?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Section 1 (LEGAL SUSPICION THRESHOLD): PASS
  Section 2 (EVIDENCE QUALITY TEST): PASS
  Section 3 (MITIGATION FAILURE CONFIRMATION): PASS
  Section 4 (TYPOLOGY CONFIRMATION (OPTIONAL)): PASS
  Section 5 (REGULATORY REASONABLENESS TEST (FINAL)): PASS

  GATE 2 DECISION: REQUIRED
  Rationale: All mandatory sections passed. STR filing is warranted.

  GATE 2 DETAIL:
  ---------------
  Section 1: PASS - Legal suspicion threshold met
    * Intent: Intent to obscure the origin, ownership, or destination of funds
    * Pattern: Sustained pattern of circular fund flows with no apparent business purpose
  Section 2: PASS - Evidence is fact-based (transaction chain)
  Section 3: PASS - Mitigations fail to explain behavior
    * No business rationale for crypto holdings
    * No contract with Baltic Trade Solutions
    * Cash structuring unexplained
  Section 4: PASS - Typology CONFIRMED (Layering)
  Section 5: PASS - Regulator would expect STR

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STR RATIONALE STATEMENT (MANDATORY OUTPUT)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Based on the totality of evidence, reasonable grounds exist to suspect
  that the transaction(s) may be related to money laundering or terrorist
  financing. This determination is based on:

  1. LAYERING PATTERN: Classic three-stage ML typology observed:
     - Placement: Crypto asset liquidation (CAD 162,000)
     - Layering: Structured cash withdrawals (CAD 29,100 in 48h)
     - Integration: Wire transfer to offshore entity (CAD 148,500)

  2. STRUCTURING: Three cash withdrawals (CAD 9,800, 9,700, 9,600)
     structured just below the CAD 10,000 LCTR threshold within 48 hours.

  3. INTENT TO OBSCURE: Multi-instrument conversion chain
     (Crypto -> Cash -> Wire) indicates intent to obscure the origin,
     ownership, and destination of funds.

  4. BUSINESS MISMATCH: Customer is a consulting firm with no prior
     crypto activity. Source of BTC acquisition unexplained.

  5. OFFSHORE TRANSFER: Wire to Estonian entity ('Baltic Trade Solutions')
     with vague purpose ('Consulting Services') and no supporting contract.

  This report is submitted in accordance with PCMLTFA s.7.

================================================================================
ABSOLUTE RULES (NO EXCEPTIONS)
================================================================================
  X PEP status alone can NEVER escalate
  X Cross-border alone can NEVER escalate
  X Risk score alone can NEVER escalate
  X 'High confidence' can NEVER override facts
  X 'Compliance comfort' is NOT a reason

  NOTE: This escalation is based on OBSERVED BEHAVIOR (layering),
        not status or score. The system correctly identified:
        - Multi-instrument transaction chain
        - Confirmed typology (Layering: Placement -> Layering -> Integration)
        - Failed mitigations
        - Legal suspicion threshold met

================================================================================
FINAL DECISION
================================================================================
Verdict:        STR
Action:         FILE_STR
STR Required:   YES
Escalation:     PERMITTED

Rationale:
  1. Gate 1 (Escalation): PERMITTED via Path 2 (Behavioral Suspicion)
  2. Gate 2 (STR): REQUIRED - All mandatory sections passed
  3. Typology: CONFIRMED (Layering - Crypto/Cash/Wire chain)
  4. Suspicion Elements: Intent + Sustained Pattern
  5. Mitigations: INSUFFICIENT (no business rationale)

================================================================================
REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
================================================================================
PCMLTFA s.7:    Reasonable grounds to suspect ML/TF
FINTRAC:        STR filing required within 30 days
STR Filing:     REQUIRED
LCTR Required:  NO (individual transactions below CAD 10,000)
                Note: Total CAD 29,100 in cash over 48h = threshold evasion

FINTRAC INDICATORS MATCHED:
  * Conversion of virtual currency to cash followed by rapid movement
  * Cash withdrawals structured below CAD 10,000 threshold
  * Funds transferred to foreign jurisdiction without clear purpose
  * Activity inconsistent with customer's stated business
  * Multi-instrument layering pattern
