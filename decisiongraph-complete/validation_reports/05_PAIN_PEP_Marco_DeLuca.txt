================================================================================
6-LAYER DECISION TAXONOMY ANALYSIS (v2.1.1)
================================================================================

CRITICAL RULES ENFORCED:
  * Hard stops ONLY from Layer 1 facts (confirmed match, not screening)
  * PEP status triggers OBLIGATION, not SUSPICION
  * FORMING typologies = OBSERVE ONLY (not escalation)
  * Status alone is NEVER sufficient for suspicion

INSTRUMENT: WIRE
HARD STOP: NO
OBLIGATIONS: 1 (EDD required - PEP)
INDICATORS: 2 (not corroborated)
TYPOLOGY MATURITY: FORMING (observe only)
MITIGATIONS: 5 (fully explains behavior)
SUSPICION: NOT ACTIVATED
TAXONOMY VERDICT: PASS WITH EDD

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CRITICAL PRINCIPLE: PEP STATUS != SUSPICION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  PEP status is a REGULATORY OBLIGATION (Layer 2), not evidence of
  wrongdoing. Enhanced Due Diligence is required, but the presence
  of a PEP flag alone can NEVER justify escalation or STR filing.

  This case demonstrates correct handling:
  * PEP status -> EDD obligation SATISFIED
  * No sanctions match, no adverse media
  * 14-year established relationship
  * Transaction purpose fully documented
  * Source of funds verified

================================================================================
DUAL-GATE DECISION SYSTEM
================================================================================

Constitutional Rule:
"Escalation is prevented by default and permitted only when
 suspicion is affirmatively proven."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GATE 1: ZERO-FALSE-ESCALATION CHECKLIST
Purpose: Are we ALLOWED to escalate?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Section A (FACT-LEVEL HARD STOP VERIFICATION): FAIL
  Section B (INSTRUMENT & CONTEXT VALIDATION): PASS
  Section C (REGULATORY OBLIGATION ISOLATION): PASS
  Section D (INDICATOR CORROBORATION TEST): FAIL

  GATE 1 DECISION: PROHIBITED
  Rationale: Section D: Indicators failed corroboration test.

  GATE 1 DETAIL:
  ---------------
  Section A: FAIL - No fact-level hard stop (no sanctions, no fraud)
  Section B: PASS - Wire instrument correctly classified
  Section C: PASS - PEP status treated as obligation only
  Section D: FAIL - Indicators not corroborated (status only)

  ESCALATION BLOCKED AT SECTION D
  Reason: PEP status and cross-border activity are not
          corroborated behavioral indicators.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GATE 2: POSITIVE STR CHECKLIST
Purpose: Are we OBLIGATED to report?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [Gate 2 not evaluated - Gate 1 blocked escalation]

  GATE 2 DECISION: PROHIBITED
  Rationale: Escalation blocked by Gate 1. STR not warranted.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NON-ESCALATION JUSTIFICATION (MANDATORY OUTPUT)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  All regulatory obligations were fulfilled. The customer's PEP status
  has been identified and Enhanced Due Diligence requirements have been
  satisfied. No sanctions match or adverse media were identified.

  Transaction activity is consistent with the customer's 14-year profile
  and fully supported by documentation. The wire transfer for property
  acquisition is consistent with the customer's known investment pattern.

  No evidence of deception, intent to conceal, or structuring pattern
  was observed. Therefore, no reasonable grounds to suspect ML/TF exist
  under PCMLTFA s.7.

  PEP status alone is NOT a basis for suspicion.

================================================================================
ABSOLUTE RULES (NO EXCEPTIONS)
================================================================================
  X PEP status alone can NEVER escalate
  X Cross-border alone can NEVER escalate
  X Risk score alone can NEVER escalate
  X 'High confidence' can NEVER override facts
  X 'Compliance comfort' is NOT a reason

  THIS CASE VALIDATES:
  * Foreign PEP with HIGH risk rating -> NO ESCALATION
  * Large cross-border wire (EUR 185,000) -> NO ESCALATION
  * EDD obligation triggered and SATISFIED
  * System correctly distinguished obligation from suspicion

================================================================================
FINAL DECISION
================================================================================
Verdict:        PASS_WITH_EDD
Action:         CLOSE_WITH_EDD_RECORDED
STR Required:   NO
Escalation:     PROHIBITED

Rationale:
  1. Gate 1 (Escalation): PROHIBITED - No fact-level hard stop,
     indicators not corroborated (PEP is status, not behavior)
  2. Gate 2 (STR): NOT EVALUATED - Gate 1 blocked escalation
  3. PEP Obligation: EDD SATISFIED (on file)
  4. Mitigations: 5 factors fully explain transaction
  5. Suspicion Elements: NONE (no intent, no deception, no pattern)

================================================================================
REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
================================================================================
EDD Status:     COMPLETED (on file)
PEP Monitoring: ACTIVE
PCMLTFA s.7:    No reasonable grounds to suspect ML/TF
FINTRAC:        All obligations fulfilled
STR Filing:     NOT REQUIRED
